        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>How to understand individual human actions is a fundamental question to modern science, which drives and incurs many social, technological, racial, religious and economic phenomena. Human dynamics tries to reveal the temporal pattern and internal mechanism of human actions in letter or electronic communications, from the perspective of continuous interactions among friends or acquaintances. For interactions between stranger to stranger, taxi industry provide fruitful phenomina and evidence to investigate the action decisions. In fact, one striking disturbing events commonly reported in taxi industry is passenger refusing or denial, whose reasons vary, including skin color, blind passenger, being a foreigner or too close destination, religion reasons and anti specific nationality, so that complaints about taxi passenger refusing have to be concerned and processed carefully by local governments. But more universal factors for this phenomena are of great significance, which might be fulfilled by big data research to obtain novel insights in this question. In this paper, we demonstrate the big data analytics application in revealing novel insights from massive taxi trace data, which, for the first time, validates the passengers denial in taxi industry and estimates the denial ratio in Beijing city. We first quantify the income differentiation facts among taxi drivers. Then we find out that choosing the drop-off places also contributes to the high income for taxi drivers, compared to the previous explanation of mobility intelligence. Moreover, we propose the pick-up, drop-off and grid diversity concepts and related diversity analysis suggest that, high income taxi drivers will deny passengers in some situations, so as to choose the passengers’ destination they prefer. Finally we design an estimation method for denial ratio and infer that high income taxi drivers will deny passengers with 8.52% likelihood in Beijing. Our work exhibits the power of big data analysis in revealing some dark side investigation.</p>

        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>When and why people change their mobile phones are important issues in mobile communications industry, because it will impact greatly on the marketing strategy and revenue estimation for both mobile operators and manufactures. It is a promising way to take use of big data to analyze and predict the phone changing event. In this paper, based on mobile user big data, first through statistical analysis, we find that three important probability distributions, i.e., power-law, log-normal, and geometric distribution, play an important role in the user behaviors. Second, the relationships between eight selected attributes and phone changing are built, for example, young people have greater intention to change their phones if they are using the phones belonging to the low occupancy phones or feature phones. Third, we verified the performance of four prediction models on phone changing event under three scenarios. Information gain ratio was used to implement attribute selection and then sampling method, cost-sensitive together with standard classifiers were used to solve imbalanced phone changing event. Experiment results show our proposed enhanced backpropagation neural network in the undersampling scenario can attain better prediction performance.</p>

        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>Vehicular mobility statistics including vehicle velocity, relative velocity and link duration between vehicles may impact greatly on V2V communications and networking but existing works based on large scale real traces are rarely reported. In this paper, we firstly present the statistical analysis on this topic using the taxi traces in one metropolis of China, which reveals the practical distribution of the mobility statistics mentioned above. We propose a computation methodology with low computation complexity to approximate vehicular communication pattern by analyzing large scale vehicular trace data. By Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), we conclude that the taxi velocity follows normal distribution and the relative velocity follows Logistic distribution in different disconnected distance. Moreover, the link duration is verified to comply with generalized Pareto distribution in different disconnected distance. Such findings are significant for designing practical transmission technology and protocols.</p>

        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>Human mobility is an interesting topic attracting researchers from various fields. In this paper, we investigate mobility of college students in campus during their full life cycle and find the demographic differences on the predictability of human mobility. We explore an extensive consuming record data set collected from a college campus. Specifically, our data set includes over 15 million consuming logs gathered from 4,741 students (with demographic information) from 2013 to 2016. We present and analyze the evolving patterns of mobility entropy by ages, academic majors, and genders. We find that entropy decreases with age increasing and entropy grouped by genders follows different distributions, which is opposite to previous studies. Our findings will supply novel insights in human mobility research and provide possible support for wireless networking design in campus.</p>

        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>The ability to closely track the traffic load of base stations is very important for resource management and energy saving in green communications. Thus how to predict the future traffic accurately is critical and some recent studies show that correlation of traffic load exists among neighboring base stations. Inspired by these conclusions, this paper proposes a novel base station traffic prediction strategy which incorporates the historical information from neighboring cells. Here, particle swarm optimization based support vector regression is selected as the basic prediction model for its good performance. The neighbor set is determined by grid search and historical information length is set through testing. Based on the real network measurement, we verify the performance improvement by incorporating neighbors' impact. Also, the extra information required is not too much, which makes the search effort affordable.</p>

        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis on voice traffic intensity measurement of large-scale mobile communication base stations. Our data set tracks over 700 base stations inside one city in Southern China over a continuous period of 18 days. We cluster base stations with k-means method based on their average traffic and the result shows four distinctive clusters, among which one cluster consisting of base stations near university campuses reveals unique calling behavior of college students. The spatial characteristics of base station traffic from global and local perspectives demonstrates that the highest global spatial correlation is around 6 AM and local non-stationarity is identified. Our insights of spatial-temporal traffic dynamics in mobile network can be leveraged into network monitoring and resource management.</p>
